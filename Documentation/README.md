Adalogger


The adalogger is able to read data and sensors that are put into it. It also has a USB connected to it that can be plugged into a computer to move the data back and forth from the computer to the adalogger. It also has battery charging abilities and a place to hold an SD card to store information and read that information as well. The Senseair K-30 is the part that actually senses the CO2 gas and the adalogger will be able to evaluate the emissions it senses. The powerboost is what can keep the project running, even while charging up. At the center of the adalogger is a place for the microchip processor. The arduino software is used to write code for the sensor and upload it.

Adaloggers


    Adaloggers are pieces of equipment that read and log data. They are capable of being taken out in the field because you can get a battery for them, but if possible, you can also use a USB cord to power the adalogger. When the K-30 senses any CO2, the adalogger reads, evaluates, and stores the information. The adalogger holds a SD card that stores any information on a sensor alongside the processor. The powerboost keeps everything going even when it is being charged. Finally, the arduino software writes code that then gets uploaded after receiving the information from the other parts.

Adalogger


     The Adalogger is a piece of hardware that acts as a data reader. Essentially, itâ€™s a sensor board for field studies that, at its core, can save data and then export it to other equipment/technologies via USB. The board itself has multiple pins, in which sensors can be attached to, that produce voltage changes- and can then be read as data through the analog(read) command. The Senseair K-30 is what actually senses the CO2. The Adalogger also has internal and external power source capabilities; which makes it favorable for field work.
