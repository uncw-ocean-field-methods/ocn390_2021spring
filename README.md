# OCN 390, Field Methods
Spring 2021

## Description of this repo's contents
Storing all shared materials related to OCN 390 here, including a course overview (below), lecture slides, documentation, and information regarding the sensor development project itself: [Sensor-Dev/README.md](Sensor-Dev/REAME.md)

## Overview
This class isn’t as much about learning about our planet as it is about learning about how we learn about our planet. That is, what tools do oceanographers use in order to study and describe what they are learning about the ocean. 

The semester's main assignment will be planning and executing a field expedition, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting your results. I hope to keep the class as hands-on and interactive as possible as this is very much a learn-by-doing topic. I do not expect you to have practice in many of the techniques that we will cover&emdash;just a curiosity and motivation to learn more.

The general format of each class (2 hrs 50 mins each) will be a short lecture followed by prototyping, data collecting, data analyzing, and/or presenting. We will do a mix of classroom (covid-restrictions-permitting), outdoor, and zoom activities.

In a 2-credit, 1-semester course, there won’t be time to go into any of these in depth, but here are some of the things that I intend to cover (not necessarily in this order).
- Fieldwork preparation, execution, and note-taking
    - Whose land/water are you on? Do you have their permission to be there and to collect (data, photos, samples, etc.)?
    - Setting goals: hypothesis-driven or exploratory?
    - Resources for planning an expedition
    - Checklists
    - Field journals/notes
    - Equipment deployment, maintenance, and recovery
- Hardware
    - State-of-the-art commercial hardware
    - Developing new instrumentation
    - Ad hoc solutions in the field (zip-ties and duct tape)
    - Iterating on your design
    - Characterization/calibration across a range of temperature, pressure, salinity, ...
- Software/Firmware/Data
    - Backing up data; too many easy options to lose data
    - Data analysis (Python, R, Julia, MATLAB, GIS software, etc.)
    - Developing your own dataloggers (C/C++, Arduino, LabVIEW)
    - How to use tools like GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Presenting your results
    - Know your audience and what you are trying to convey
    - PowerPoint or other slideshow presentation with oral component
    - Word or other written document
    - Online interactive format (e.g., Esri StoryMaps)
    - Open access? Well documented? FAIR?
